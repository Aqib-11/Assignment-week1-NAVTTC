sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4, sub5 = map(int, input("Enter obtained number of 5 subjects(separated by space): ").split())
total_marks = sub1 + sub2 + sub3 + sub4 + sub5
print("Total Marks in 5 subjects are: ", total_marks)
#let's assume each subject has 100 marks
percentage = (total_marks/500) *100
print("Percentage of total marks is: ",percentage,"%")
avg = total_marks/5
