#Question No 7
#Distribute Items Equally - You have n candies and k students.
#Write a program to find:
#how many candies each student gets
#how many are left

n = int(input("Enter number of candies: "))
k = int(input("Enter number of students: "))

#let take out the infinity issue

if k == 0:
    print("No student to distribute candies.")
elif n < k:
       print("The No of candies are less than the no of students to distribute equally.\nEnter candies equal to or greater than No of students.")
else:
    no_of_candies = n // k  #using // to get the quotient number
    left_candies = n % k    #using % to get the remainder
    print("The no of candies each student got: ", no_of_candies)
    print("The left over candies are: ", left_candies)

#we can also solve this problem through loop
#until and unless the condition is not true
#the loop will ask again and again for correct input

#initialize first
